# UIKit

In this project I built a simple game that requires users to answer a question by tapping a UIButton.

I learned how to program @IBActions to buttons using the interface builder in combination with the editor and using 
the button's tag identifier to differentiate between buttons in code. The project also touched on one of the ways of 
using the AutoLayout feature to add horizontal and vertical spacing to the buttons. I added some small styling to the 
buttons by adding a border and then changing the color of the border. At the end of the project I learned how to implement
a UIAlertViewController that displays an alert to the user with a title and a message, and passes in a function to call 
upon dismissing the alert. This alert was used to display the user's score and whether or not they answered the question 
correctly.

I had to add a few things when I was finished such as:
    - Displaying to the user the answer they chose when it was incorrect
    - Adding a score label to the navigationBar
    - and restarting the game after 10 questions had been asked
